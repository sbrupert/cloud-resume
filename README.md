# Cloud Resume Challenge

My take on the Cloud Resume Challenge. The [Cloud Resume](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/) challenge is a resume project that is designed to help build and demonstrate skills relevant to a career in the Cloud.

However, I've decided to tweak the challenge with some certain goals in mind:

1. Learn more Python.
2. Stay within the Google Cloud Free Tier.
3. Demonstrate Front to Back monitoring using Datadog.

A full blog post will be coming soon describing the project in greater detail. For now, you can checkout the READMEs in each of this repo's subdirectories to learn more about each major component.
